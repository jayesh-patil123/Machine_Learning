# Machine_Learning
In This playlist I have been Covered the basics of Machine Learning. In Which I have been Used the python Libraries Like Numpy , Pandas , Seaborn , Matplotlib , etc. and i have been already uploaded the Dataset you can use it.

1] Supervised Learning
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * ridge and Lasso's Regression
  * Decision Tree Algorithm
  * Random Forest Algorithm
  * K- Nearest Neighbor
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Naive Bayes

2] Unsupervised Learning
  * K-Means Algorithm
  * PCA (Principal Component Analysis )
  * Clustering
  * Time series Algorithm
  * ARIMA and Differencing Techniques

In this playlist everthing is cleared like Data Cleaning , Data Preprocessing, Data Sampling, Model Building , accuracy of the model , Data Visualizations, etc .
